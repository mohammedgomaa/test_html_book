N OFFERING this work to the public the publishers
wish to lay before those who sing or who are about
to study singing, the simple, fundamental rules of
the art based on common sense. The two greatest living
exponents of the art of singing&#8212;Luisa Tetrazzini
and Enrico Caruso&#8212;have been chosen as examples, and
their talks on singing have additional weight from the
fact that what they have to say has been printed exactly
as it was uttered, the truths they expound are driven
home forcefully, and what they relate so simply is
backed by years of experience and emphasized by the
results they have achieved as the two greatest artists
in the world.
<p>
Much has been said about the Italian Method of
Singing. It is a question whether anyone really knows
what the phrase means. After all, if there be a right
way to sing, then all other ways must be wrong.
Books have been written on breathing, tone production
and what singers should eat and wear, etc., etc., all
tending to make the singer self-conscious and to sing
with the brain rather than with the heart. To quote
Mme. Tetrazzini: &#8220;You can train the voice, you can
take a raw material and make it a finished production;
not so with the heart.&#8221;
<p>
The country is overrun with inferior teachers of singing;
men and women who have failed to get before the
<a name="p6"><u>public</u></a>, <span class="even"><a href="#nav">6</a></span> turn to teaching without any practical experience,
and, armed only with a few methods, teach these
alike to all pupils, ruining many good voices. Should
these pupils change teachers, even for the better, then
begins the weary undoing of the false method, often
with no better result.
<p>
To these unfortunate pupils this book is of inestimable
value. He or she could not consistently choose such
teachers after reading its pages. Again the simple
rules laid down and tersely and interestingly set forth
not only carry conviction with them, but tear away the
veil of mystery that so often is thrown about the divine
art.
<p>
Luisa Tetrazzini and Enrico Caruso show what not
to do, as well as what to do, and bring the pupil back
to first principles&#8212;the art of singing naturally.</div>

World-Famous Prima Donna</span>
</center>

<div class="book">
<br>
<span class="dropcap">L</span>
<p class="dropcap">
UISA TETRAZZINI, the most famous Italian
coloratura soprano of the day, declares that she
began to sing before she learned to talk. Her
parents were not musical, but her elder sister, now
the wife of the eminent conductor Cleofante Campanini,
was a public singer of established reputation,
and her success roused her young sister&#8217;s ambition to
become a great artist. Her parents were well to do,
her father having a large army furnishing store in
Florence, and they did not encourage her in her
determination to become a prima donna. One prima donna,
said her father, was enough for any family.
<p>
Luisa did not agree with him. If one prima donna is
good, she argued, why would not two be better? So
she never desisted from her importunity until she was
permitted to become a pupil of Professor Coccherani,
vocal instructor at the Lycée. At this time she had
committed to memory more than a dozen grand opera
rôles, and at the end of six months the professor
confessed that he could do nothing more for her voice; that
she was ready for a career.
<p>
She made her bow to the Florentine opera going
public, one of the most critical in Italy, as Inez, in
Meyerbeer&#8217;s &#8220;L&#8217;Africaine,&#8221; and her success was so
pronounced that she was engaged at a salary of $100 a
month, a phenomenal beginning for a young singer.
Queen Margherita was present on the occasion and
com<a name="p8"><u>plimented</u></a> <span class="even"><a href="#nav">8</a></span> her highly and prophesied for her a great
career. She asked the trembling débutante how old
she was, and in the embarrassment of the moment Luisa
made herself six years older than she really was. This
is one noteworthy instance in which a public singer
failed to discount her age.
<p>
Fame came speedily, but for a long time it was
confined to Europe and Latin America. She sang seven
seasons in St. Petersburg, three in Mexico, two in
Madrid, four in Buenos Aires, and even on the Pacific
coast of America before she appeared in New York.
She had sung Lucia more than 200 times before her
first appearance at Covent Garden, and the twenty
curtain calls she received on that occasion came as the
greatest surprise of her career. She had begun to
believe that she could never be appreciated by English-speaking
audiences and the ovation almost overcame
her.
<p>
It was by the merest chance that Mme. Tetrazzini
ever came to the Manhattan Opera House in New York.
The diva&#8217;s own account of her engagement is as follows:
<p>
&#8220;I was in London, and for a wonder I had a week, a
wet week, on my hands. You know people will do
anything in a wet week in London.
<p>
&#8220;There were contracts from all over the Continent
and South America pending. There was much discussion
naturally in regard to settlements and arrangements
of one kind and another.
<p>
&#8220;Suddenly, just like that&#8221;&#8212;she makes a butterfly
gesture&#8212;&#8220;M. Hammerstein came, and just like that&#8221;&#8212;a
duplicate gesture&#8212;&#8220;I made up my mind that I would
come here. If his offer to me had been seven days
later I should not have signed, and if I had not I should
undoubtedly never have come, for a contract that I
<a name="p9"><u>might</u></a> <span class="odd"><a href="#nav">9</a></span> have signed to go elsewhere would probably have
been for a number of years.&#8221;
<p>
Voice experts confess that they are not able to solve
the mystery of Mme. Tetrazzini&#8217;s wonderful management
of her breathing.
<p>
&#8220;It is perfectly natural,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I breathe low
down in the diaphragm, not, as some do, high up in the
upper part of the chest. I always hold some breath in
reserve for the crescendos, employing only what is
absolutely necessary, and I renew the breath wherever it is
easiest.
<p>
&#8220;In breathing I find, as in other matters pertaining to
singing, that as one goes on and practices, no matter
how long one may have been singing, there are
constantly new surprises awaiting one. You may have
been accustomed for years to take a note in a certain
way, and after a long while you discover that, while it
is a very good way, there is a better.&#8221;</div>

<p class="dropcap">
HERE is only one way to sing correctly, and that
is to sing naturally, easily, comfortably.
<p>
The height of vocal art is to have no apparent
method, but to be able to sing with perfect facility
from one end of the voice to the other, emitting all the
notes clearly and yet with power and having each note
of the scale sound the same in quality and tonal beauty
as the ones before and after.
<p>
There are many methods which lead to the goal of
natural singing&#8212;that is to say, the production of the
voice with ease, beauty and with perfect control.
<p>
Some of the greatest teachers in the world reach this
point apparently by diverging roads.
<p>
Around the art of singing there has been formed a
cult which includes an entire jargon of words meaning
one thing to the singer and another thing to the rest of
the world and which very often doesn&#8217;t mean the same
thing to two singers of different schools.
<p>
In these talks with you I am going to try to use the
simplest words, and the few idioms which I will have to
take from my own language I will translate to you as
clearly as I can, so that there can be no
misunderstanding.
<p>
Certainly the highest art and a lifetime of work and
study are necessary to acquire an easy emission of tone.
<p>
There are quantities of wonderful natural voices,
particularly among the young people of Switzerland and
Italy, and the American voice is especially noted for its
purity and the beauty of its tone in the high registers.
<a name="p11"><u>But</u></a> <span class="odd"><a href="#nav">11</a></span> these naturally untrained voices soon break or fail
if they are used much unless the singer supplements the
natural, God-given vocal gifts with a conscious understanding
of how the vocal apparatus should be used.
<p>
The singer must have some knowledge of his or her
anatomical structure, particularly the structure of the
throat, mouth and face, with its resonant cavities, which
are so necessary for the right production of the voice.
<p>
Besides that, the lungs and diaphragm and the whole
breathing apparatus must be understood, because the
foundation of singing is breathing and breath control.
<p>
A singer must be able to rely on his breath, just as he
relies upon the solidity of the ground beneath his feet.
<p>
A shaky, uncontrolled breath is like a rickety foundation
on which nothing can be built, and until that foundation
has been developed and strengthened the would-be
singer need expect no satisfactory results.
<p>
From the girls to whom I am talking especially I
must now ask a sacrifice&#8212;the singer cannot wear tight
corsets and should not wear corsets of any kind which
come up higher than the lowest rib.
<p>
In other words, the corset must be nothing but a belt,
but with as much hip length as the wearer finds
convenient and necessary.
<p>
In order to insure proper breathing capacity it is
understood that the clothing must be absolutely loose
around the chest and also across the lower part of the
back, for one should breathe with the back of the lungs
as well as with the front.
<p>
In my years of study and work I have developed
my own breathing capacity until I am somewhat the
despair of the fashionable modiste, but I have a diaphragm
and a breath on which I can rely at all times.
<p>
In learning to breathe it is well to think of the lungs
<a name="p12"><u>as</u></a> <span class="even"><a href="#nav">12</a></span> empty sacks, into which the air is dropping like a
weight, so that you think first of filling the bottom of
your lungs, then the middle part, and so on until no
more air can be inhaled.
<p>
Inhale short breaths through the nose. This, of
course, is only an exercise for breath development.
<p>
Now begin to inhale from the bottom of the lungs
first.
<p>
Exhale slowly and feel as if you were pushing the
air against your chest. If you can get this sensation
later when singing it will help you very greatly to get
control of the breath and to avoid sending too much
breath through the vocal chords.
<p>
The breath must be sent out in an even, steady flow.
<p>
You will notice when you begin to sing, if you watch
yourself very carefully, that, first, you will try to
inhale too much air; secondly, you will either force it
all out at once, making a breathy note, or in trying to
control the flow of air by the diaphragm you will suddenly
cease to send it forth at all and will be making
the sound by pressure from the throat.
<p>
There must never be any pressure from the throat.
The sound must be made from the continued flow of air.
<p>
You must learn to control this flow of air, so that no
muscular action of the throat can shut it off.
<p>
Open the throat wide and start your note by the
pressure breath. The physical sensation should be
first an effort on the part of the diaphragm to press
the air up against the chest box, then the sensation of
a perfectly open throat, and, lastly, the sensation that
the air is passing freely into the cavities of the head.
<p>
The quantity of sound is controlled by the breath.
<p>
In diminishing the tone the opening of the throat
remains the same. Only the quantity of breath given
<a name="p13"><u>forth</u></a> <span class="odd"><a href="#nav">13</a></span> is diminished. That is done by the diaphragm
muscles.
<p>
&#8220;Filare la voce,&#8221; to spin the voice from a tiny little
thread into a breadth of sound and then diminish
again, is one of the most beautiful effects in singing.
<p>
It is accomplished by the control of the breath, and
its perfect accomplishment means the complete mastery
of the greatest difficulty in learning to sing.
<p>
I think one of the best exercises for learning to control
the voice by first getting control of the breath is to
stand erect in a well-ventilated room or out of doors and
slowly snuff in air through the nostrils, inhaling in
little puffs, as if you were smelling something.
<p>
Take just a little bit of air at a time and feel as if you
were filling the very bottom of your lungs and also the
back of your lungs.
<p>
When you have the sensation of being full up to the
neck retain the air for a few seconds and then very
slowly send it out in little puffs again.
<p>
This is a splendid exercise, but I want to warn you
not to practise any breathing exercise to such an
extent that you make your heart beat fast or feel like
strangling.
<p>
Overexercising the lungs is as bad as not exercising
them enough and the results are often harmful.
<p>
Like everything else in singing, you want to learn this
gradually. Never neglect it, because it is the very
foundation of your art. But don&#8217;t try to develop a
diaphragm expansion of five inches in two weeks.
<p>
Indeed, it is not the expansion that you are working
for.
<p>
I have noticed this one peculiarity about young
singers&#8212;if they have an enormous development of the
diaphragm they think they should be able to sing, no
<a name="p14"><u>matter</u></a> <span class="even"><a href="#nav">14</a></span> what happens. A girl came to see me once
whose figure was really entirely out of proportion, the
lower part of the lungs having been pressed out quite
beyond even artistic lines.
<p>
&#8220;You see, madam,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;I have studied
breathing. Why, I have such a strong diaphragm I
can move the piano with it!&#8221; And she did go right
up to my piano and, pushing on this strong diaphragm
of hers, moved the piano a fraction of an inch from its
place.
<p>
I was quite aghast. I had never met such an athletic
singer. When I asked her to let me hear her voice,
however, a tiny stream of contralto sound issued from
those powerful lungs.
<p>
She had developed her breathing capacity, but when
she sang she held her breath back.
<p>
I have noticed that a great many people do this, and
it is one of the things that must be overcome in the very
beginning of the study of singing.
<p>
Certain young singers take in an enormous breath,
stiffening every muscle in order to hold the air, thus
depriving their muscles of all elasticity.
<p>
They will then shut off the throat and let only the
smallest fraction of air escape, just enough to make a
sound. Too much inbreathing and too violent an
effort at inhaling will not help the singer at all.
<p>
People have said that they cannot see when I breathe.
Well, they certainly cannot say that I am ever short of
breath even if I do try to breathe invisibly. When I
breathe I scarcely draw my diaphragm in at all, but I
feel the air fill my lungs and I feel my upper ribs
expand.
<p>
In singing I always feel as if I were forcing my breath
against my chest, and, just as in the exercises accord<a name="p15"><u>ing</u></a> <span class="odd"><a href="#nav">15</a></span>
to Delsarte you will find the chest leads in all physical
movements, so in singing you should feel this firm
support of the chest of the highest as well as the lowest
notes.
<p>
I have seen pupils, trying to master the art of
breathing, holding themselves as rigidly as drum
majors.
<p>
Now this rigidity of the spinal column will in no
way help you in the emission of tone, nor will it increase
the breath control. In fact, I don&#8217;t think it would
even help you to stand up straight, although it would
certainly give one a stiff appearance and one far
removed from grace.
<p>
A singer should stand freely and easily and should
feel as if the chest were leading, but should not feel
constrained or stiff in any part of the ribs or lungs.
<p>
From the minute the singer starts to emit a tone the
supply of breath must be emitted steadily from the
chamber of air in the lungs. It must never be held
back once.
<p>
The immediate pressure of the air should be felt more
against the chest. I know of a great many singers who,
when they come to very difficult passages, put their
hands on their chests, focusing their attention on this
one part of the mechanism of singing.
<p>
The audience, of course, thinks the prima donna&#8217;s
hand is raised to her heart, when, as a matter of fact,
the prima donna, with a difficult bit of singing before
her, is thinking of her technique and the foundation of
that technique&#8212;breath control.
<p>
This feeling of singing against the chest with the
weight of air pressing up against it is known as &#8220;breath
support,&#8221; and in Italian we have even a better word,
&#8220;apoggio,&#8221; which is breath prop. The diaphragm in
<a name="p16"><u>English</u></a> <span class="even"><a href="#nav">16</a></span> may be called the bellows of the lungs, but the
apoggio is the deep breath regulated by the diaphragm.
<p>
The attack of the sound must come from the apoggio,
or breath prop. In attacking the very highest
notes it is essential, and no singer can really get the
high notes or vocal flexibility or strength of tone without
the attack coming from this seat of respiration.
<p>
In practising the trill or staccato tones the pressure
of the breath must be felt even before the sound is
heard. The beautiful, clear, bell-like tones that die
away into a soft piano are tones struck on the apoggio
and controlled by the steady soft pressure of the breath
emitted through a perfectly open throat, over a low
tongue and resounding in the cavities of the mouth or
head.
<p>
Never for a moment sing without this apoggio, this
breath prop. Its development and its constant use
mean the restoration of sick or fatigued voices and the
prolonging of all one&#8217;s vocal powers into what is
wrongly called old age.</div>

HE tongue is a veritable stumbling block in the
path of the singer. The tongue is an enormous
muscle compared with the other parts of the
throat and mouth, and its roots particularly can by
a slight movement block the passage of the throat
pressing against the larynx. This accounts for much
of the pinched singing we hear.
<p>
When the tongue forms a mountain in the back
part of the mouth the singer produces what you call
in English slang &#8220;a hot potato tone&#8221;&#8212;that is to say,
a tone that sounds as if it were having much difficulty
to get through the mouth. In very fact, it is having
this difficulty, for it has to pass over the back of the
tongue.
<p>
The would-be singer has to learn to control the
tongue muscles and, above all things, to learn to
relax the tongue and to govern it at will, so that it
never stiffens and forms that hard lump which can
be plainly felt immediately beneath the chin under
the jaw.
<p>
It requires a great deal of practice to gain control
of the tongue, and there are many different exercises
which purport to be beneficial in gaining complete
mastery over it. One, for instance, is to throw the
tongue out as far forward as possible without stiffening
it and then draw it back slowly. This can be done
in front of a mirror by trying to throw the tongue not
only from the tip, but from the root, keeping the
sides of the tongue broad. Another way is to catch
hold of the two sides of the tongue with the fingers
and pull it out gently.
<p>
<a name="p18"><u>For</u></a> <span class="even"><a href="#nav">18</a></span> my part, I scarcely approve of these mechanical
ways of gaining control of the tongue except in cases
where the singer is phlegmatic of temperament and
cannot be made to feel the various sensations of stiff
tongue or tongue drawn far back in other ways.
Ordinarily I think they make the singer conscious,
nervous and more likely to stiffen the tongue in a
wild desire to relax it and keep it flat.
<p>
These exercises, however, combined with exercises
in diction, help to make the tongue elastic, and the
more elastic and quick this muscle becomes the clearer
will be the singer&#8217;s diction and the more flexible will
be her voice.
<p>
The correct position of the tongue is raised from
the back, lying flat in the mouth, the flattened tip
beneath the front teeth, with the sides slightly raised
so as to form a slight furrow in it. When the tongue
is lying too low a lump under the chin beneath the
jaw will form in singing and the tight muscles can
be easily felt.
<p>
When the jaw is perfectly relaxed and the tongue
lies flat in the mouth there will be a slight hollow
under the chin and no stiffness in the muscles.
<p>
The tip of the tongue of course is employed in the
pronunciation of the consonants and must be so agile
that the minute it has finished its work it at once
resumes the correct position.
<p>
In ascending the scale the furrow in the tongue
increases as we come to the higher notes. It is here
that the back of the palate begins to draw up in order
to add to the resonance of the head notes, giving the
cavities of the head free play.
<p>
You can easily see your back palate working by
opening your mouth wide and giving yourself the
<a name="p19"><u>sensation</u></a> <span class="odd"><a href="#nav">19</a></span> of one about to sneeze. You will see far
back in the throat, way behind the nose, a soft spot
that will draw up of itself as the sneeze becomes more
imminent. That little point is the soft palate. It
must be drawn up for the high notes in order to get
the head resonance. As a singer advances in her art
she can do this at will.
<p>
The adjustment of throat, tongue and palate, all
working together, will daily respond more easily to
her demands. However, she should be able consciously
to control each part by itself.
<p>
The conscious direction of the voice and command
of the throat are necessary. Frequently in opera
the singer, sitting or lying in some uncomfortable
position which is not naturally convenient for
producing the voice, will consciously direct her notes
into the head cavities by opening up the throat and
lifting the soft palate. For instance, in the role of
Violetta the music of the last act is sung lying down.
In order to get proper resonance to some of the high
notes I have to start them in the head cavity by means,
of course, of the apoggio, or breath prop, without
which the note would be thin and would have no
body to it.
<p>
The sensation that I have is of a slight pressure of
breath striking almost into a direct line into the
cavity behind the forehead over the eyes without
any obstruction or feeling in the throat at all.
<p>
This is the correct attack for the head tone, or a
tone taken in the upper register. Before I explain
the registers to you I must tell you one of the funniest
compliments I ever received. A very flattering person
was comparing my voice to that of another high
soprano whom I very much admire.
<p>
<a name="p20"><u>&#8220;Her</u></a> <span class="even"><a href="#nav">20</a></span> voice is beautiful, particularly in the upper
register,&#8221; I insisted when the other lady was being
criticized.
<p>
&#8220;Ah, madame,&#8221; responded the flattering critic,
&#8220;but your registers give out so much more warmth.&#8221;
<p>
I think this joke is too good to lose, also the criticism,
while unjust to the other singer, is interesting to the
student, because in the high register, which includes
in some voices all the notes above middle C, the notes
are thin and cold unless supported by the apoggio,
the breath prop, of which I have told you so much.
People ask whether there are such things as vocal
registers. Certainly there are. There are three always
and sometimes four in very high voices. The ordinary
registers are the low, the middle, the high voice, or
head voice, and sometimes the second high voice,
which has been called the flagellant voice.
<p>
A vocal register is a series of tones which are produced
by a certain position of the larynx, tongue and palate.
In the woman&#8217;s voice the middle register takes in the
notes from E on the first line of the staff about to
middle C. The head voice begins at middle C and
runs up sometimes to the end of the voice, sometimes
to B flat or C, where it joins the second head register,
which I have heard ascend into a whistle in phenomenal
voices cultivated only in this register and
useless for vocal work.
<p>
Though the registers exist and the tones in middle,
below and above are not produced in the same manner,
the voice should be so equalized that the change in
registers cannot be heard. And a tone sung with a
head voice and in the low voice should have the
same degree of quality, resonance and power.
<p>
As the voice ascends in the scale each note is
dif<a name="p21"><u>ferent</u></a>, <span class="odd"><a href="#nav">21</a></span> and as one goes on up the positions of the
organ of the throat cannot remain the same for several
different tones. But there should never be an abrupt
change, either audible to the audience or felt in the
singer&#8217;s throat. Every tone must be imperceptibly
prepared, and upon the elasticity of the vocal organs
depends the smoothness of the tone production.
Adjusting the vocal apparatus to the high register
should be both imperceptible and mechanical whenever
a high note has to be sung.
<p>
In the high register the head voice, or voice which
vibrates in the head cavities, should be used chiefly.
The middle register requires palatal resonance, and
the first notes of the head register and the last ones
of the middle require a judicious blending of both.
The middle register can be dragged up to the high
notes, but always at the cost first of the beauty of
the voice and then of the voice itself, for no organ
can stand being used wrongly for a long time.
<p>
This is only one of the reasons that so many fine
big voices go to pieces long before they should.
<p>
In an excess of enthusiasm the young singer
attempts to develop the high notes and make them
sound&#8212;in her own ears, at all events&#8212;as big as the
middle voice. The pure head tone sounds small and
feeble to the singer herself, and she would rather use
the chest quality, but the head tone has the piercing,
penetrating quality which makes it tell in a big hall,
while the middle register, unless used in its right
place, makes the voice muffled, heavy and lacking
in vibrancy. Though to the singer the tone may
seem immense, in reality it lacks resonance.
<p>
A singer must never cease listening to herself
intelligently and never neglect cultivating the head
<a name="p22"><u>tone</u></a> <span class="even"><a href="#nav">22</a></span> or over-tone of the voice, which is its salvation,
for it means vibrancy, carrying power and youth to
a voice. Without it the finest voice soon becomes
worn and off pitch. Used judiciously it will preserve
a voice into old age.</div>

<span class="dropcap">I</span>
<p class="dropcap">
N my first talk I said a few words, but not half
enough, on the subject of breath control.
<p>
My second talk was the physiological aspect of
the throat, head and tongue, for it is necessary to
become thoroughly acquainted with the mechanism
with which you are to work before you can really sing.
Today I&#8217;m going to take up the subject of tone emission
and the attack.
<p>
A great many singers suffer from the defect called
&#8220;throatiness&#8221; of the emission&#8212;that is to say, they
attack or start the note in the throat. Sooner or later
this attack will ruin the most beautiful voice. As I
have said before, the attack of the note must come
from the apoggio, or breath prop. But to have the
attack pure and perfectly in tune you must have the
throat entirely open, for it is useless to try to sing if the
throat is not sufficiently open to let the sound pass
freely. Throaty tones or pinched tones are tones which
are trying to force themselves through a half-closed
throat blocked either by insufficient opening of the
larynx or by stoppage of the throat passage, due to the
root of the tongue being forced down and back too hard
or possibly to a low, soft palate.
<p>
In order to have the throat perfectly open it is
necessary to have the jaw absolutely relaxed.
<p>
I have found in studying different nationalities
that it is fairly easy for the French and Spanish people
to learn this relaxation of jaw and the opening of the
throat, but the English-speaking people generally talk
with the throat half shut and even talk through
half-<a name="p24"><u>shut</u></a> <span class="even"><a href="#nav">24</a></span> teeth. Sometime, when you are talking rapidly,
suddenly put your hand up to your jaw. You will find
that it is stiff; that the muscles beneath it (tongue
muscles) are tight and hard; that the jaw seldom goes
down very far in pronouncing any of the English words,
whereas in singing the jaw should be absolutely relaxed,
going down and back just as far as it can with ease.
<p>
The jaw is attached to the skull right beneath the
temples in front of the ears. By placing your two
fingers there and dropping the jaw you will find that a
space between the skull and jaw grows as the jaw drops.
<p>
In singing this space must be as wide as is possible,
for that indicates that the jaw is dropped down, giving
its aid to the opening at the back of the throat. It will
help the beginner sometimes to do simple relaxing
exercises, feeling the jaw drop with the fingers. It must
drop down, and it is not necessary to open the mouth
wide, because the jaw is relaxed to its utmost.
<p>
However, for a beginner it is as well to practice
opening the mouth wide, being sure to lower the jaw at
the back. Do this many times a day without emitting
any sound merely to get the feeling of what an open
throat is really like. You will presently begin to yawn
after you have done the exercise a couple of times. In
yawning or in starting to drink a sip of water the throat
is widely open, and the sensation is a correct one which
the singer must study to reproduce.
<p>
I have noticed a great many actors and actresses in
America who speak with jaws tightly closed, or at least
closed to such an extent that only the smallest emission
of breath is possible. Such a voice production will
never allow the actor to express any varying degree of
emotion and will also completely eradicate any natural
beauty of tone which the voice may have. However,
<a name="p25"><u>this</u></a> <span class="odd"><a href="#nav">25</a></span> is a fault which can easily be overcome by practicing
this daily relaxation of the jaw and always when singing
breathing as if the jaw hung perfectly loose, or, better
still, as if you had none at all. When you can see a
vocalist pushing on the jaw you can be perfectly certain
that the tone she is emitting at that moment is a forced
note and that the whole vocal apparatus is being tortured
to create what is probably not a pleasant noise.
<p>
Any kind of mental distress will cause the jaw to
stiffen and will have an immediate effect upon the
voice. This is one of the reasons why a singer must
learn to control her emotions and must not subject
herself to any harrowing experiences, even such as
watching a sensational spectacle, before she is going to
sing. Fear, worry, fright&#8212;stage as well as other
kinds&#8212;set the jaw. So does too great a determination
to succeed. A singer&#8217;s mind must control all of her
feelings if it is going to control her voice. She must
be able even to surmount a feeling of illness or stage
fright and to control her vocal apparatus, as well as her
breath, no matter what happens.
<p>
The singer should feel as if her jaw were detached and
falling away from her face. As one great singer
expresses it: &#8220;You should have the jaw of an imbecile
when emitting a tone. In fact, you shouldn&#8217;t know
that you have one.&#8221; Let us take the following passage
from &#8220;The Marriage of Figaro,&#8221; by Mozart:

<center><br><img src="Figaro.jpg" alt="passage from &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;"></center><br>

<p>
This would make an excellent exercise for the jaw.
Sing only the vowels, dropping the jaw as each one is
attacked&#8212;&#8220;o, eh, ah.&#8221; The o, of course, is pronounced
<a name="p26"><u>like</u></a> <span class="even"><a href="#nav">26</a></span> the English o and the i in voi like e. The e in che
is pronounced like the English a. Sapete is pronounced
sahpata. You now have the vowels, o, ee, a, ah, a.
Open the throat wide, drop the jaw and pronounce
the tones on a note in the easiest part of your voice.
<p>
Do not attack a note at the same time that you are
inhaling. That is too soon. Take the breath through
the nose, of course, and give it an instant to settle before
attacking the sound. In this way you will avoid the
stroke of the glottis which is caused by the sudden and
uncontrolled emission of the accumulated breath. In
attacking a note the breath must be directed to the
focusing point on the palate which lies just at the
critical spot, different for every tone. In attacking a
note, however, there must be no pressure on this place,
because if there is the overtones will be unable to soar
and sound with the tone.
<p>
From the moment the note is attacked the breath
must flow out with it. It is a good idea to feel at first
as if one were puffing out the breath. This is particularly
good for the high notes on which a special stress
must be laid always to attack with the breath and not
to press or push with the throat. As long as the tone
lasts the gentle but uninterrupted outpouring of the
breath must continue behind it. This breath pressure
insures the strength and, while holding the note to the
focusing point on the palate, insures its pitch. In a
general way it can be said that the medium tones of the
voice have their focusing point in the middle part of the
palate, the lower tones coming nearer to the teeth to be
centralized and the high notes giving the sensation of
finding their focusing point in the high arch at the back
of the mouth and going out, as it were, through the
crown of the head.
<p>
<a name="p27"><u>The</u></a> <span class="odd"><a href="#nav">27</a></span> resonance in the head cavities is soon perceived
by those who are beginning to sing. Sometimes in
producing their first high notes young people become
nervous and irritated when singing high tones at the
curious buzzing in the head and ears. After a short
time, however, this sensation is no longer an irritation,
and the singer can gauge in a way where his tones are
placed by getting a mental idea of where the resonance
to each particular tone should be.
<p>
High notes with plenty of head vibration can only
be obtained when the head is clear and the nasal cavities
unobstructed by mucous membrane or by any of the
depression which comes from physical or mental cause.
The best way to lose such depression is to practice.
Practicing the long scale, being careful to use the different
registers, as described later, will almost invariably
even out the voice and clear out the head if continued
long enough, and will enable the singer to overcome
nervous or mental depression as well.
<p>
The different sensations in producing the tone vary
according to the comparative height and depth. Beginning
from the medium tones, the singer will feel as if
each tone of the descending scale were being sung farther
outside of the mouth, the vibration hitting the
upper teeth as it goes out, whereas with the ascending
scale the vibrations pass through the nasal cavities,
through the cavity in the forehead and up back into the
head, until one feels as if the tone were being formed
high over the head at the back.
<p>
I want to say right here that whenever a young singer
feels uncomfortable when singing he or she is singing
incorrectly.
<p>
In attacking the note on the breath, particularly in
the high notes, it is quite possible that at first the voice
<a name="p28"><u>will</u></a> <span class="even"><a href="#nav">28</a></span> not respond. For a long time merely an emission
or breath or perhaps a little squeak on the high note is
all that can be hoped for. If, however, this is continued,
eventually the head voice will be joined to the
breath, and a faint note will find utterance which with
practice will develop until it becomes an easy and
brilliant tone.
<p>
The reason that the tone has not been able to come
forth is because the vocal apparatus cannot adjust itself
to the needs of the vocal chords or because they
themselves have not accustomed themselves to respond to
the will of the singer and are too stiff to perform their
duty.
<p>
The scale is the greatest test of voice production.
No opera singer, no concert singer, who cannot sing a
perfect scale can be said to be a technician or to have
achieved results in her art. Whether the voice be
soprano, mezzo or contralto, each note should be perfect
of its kind, and the note of each register should partake
sufficiently of the quality of the next register above or
below it in order not to make the transition noticeable
when the voice ascends or descends the scale. This
blending of the registers is obtained by the intelligence
of the singer in mixing the different tone qualities of
the registers, using as aids the various formations of the
lips, mouth and throat and the ever present apoggio
without which no perfect scale can be sung.</div>

<span class="dropcap">I</span>
<p class="dropcap">
N studying a new rôle I am in the habit of practicing
in front of a mirror in order to get an idea of the
effect of a facial expression and to see that it does
not take away from the correct position of the mouth.
<p>
The young singer should practice constantly in front
of a mirror as soon as she begins to sing songs or to express
emotions in her music, for the girl with the expressive
face is likely to contort her mouth so that the correct
emission of tones is impossible.
<p>
The dramatic artist depends largely for her expression
on the changing lines of the mouth, chin and jaw,
and in any lines spoken which denote command or will
you will see the actor&#8217;s jaw setting and becoming rigid
with the rest of the facial mask.
<p>
Now, a singer can never allow the facial expression to
alter the position of the jaw or mouth. Facial expression
for the singer must concern itself chiefly with the
eyes and forehead.
<p>
The mouth must remain the same, and the jaw must
ever be relaxed, whether the song is one of deep
intensity or a merry scale of laughter.
<p>
The mouth in singing should always smile lightly.
This slight smile at once relaxes the lips, allowing them
free play for the words which they and the tongue must
form and also gives the singer a slight sensation of
uplift necessary for singing.
<p>
It is impossible to sing well when mentally depressed
or even physically indisposed slightly. Unless one has
complete control over the entire vocal apparatus and
unless one can simulate a smile one does not feel the
<a name="p30"><u>voice</u></a> <span class="even"><a href="#nav">30</a></span> will lack some of its resonant quality, particularly
in the upper notes, where the smiling position of
the mouth adjusts the throat and air passages for the
emission of light tones.
<p>
The lips are of the greatest aid in shaping and shading
the tones. Wagnerian singers, for instance, who employ
trumpet-like notes in certain passages are often seen
shaping their lips like the mouthpiece of a trumpet,
with a somewhat square opening, the lips protruding.
<p>
However, this can be practiced only after perfect
relaxation of the jaw and control of the tongue have
been accomplished.
<p>
A singer&#8217;s mouth must always look pleasant, not only
because it creates a disagreeable impression on the
audience to see a crooked and contorted mouth, but
also because natural and correct voice production
requires a mouth shaped almost into a smile.
<p>
Too wide a smile often accompanies what is called
&#8220;the white voice.&#8221; This is a voice production where
a head resonance alone is employed, without sufficient
of the apoggio or enough of the mouth resonance to
give the tone a vital quality. This &#8220;white voice&#8221;
should be thoroughly understood and is one of the many
shades of tone a singer can use at times, just as the
impressionist uses various unusual colors to produce
certain atmospheric effects.
<p>
<a name="n1r">For</a> instance, in the mad scene in &#8220;Lucia&#8221; the use of
the &#8220;white voice&#8221; suggests the babbling of the mad
woman, as the same voice in the last act of &#8220;Traviata&#8221;
or in the last act of &#8220;Bohème&#8221;<a href="#n1"><sup>1</sup></a> suggests utter physical
exhaustion and the approach of death.
<p>
An entire voice production on these colorless lines,
however, would always lack the brilliancy and the
vitality which inspire enthusiasm.
<p>
<a name="p31"><u>One</u></a> <span class="odd"><a href="#nav">31</a></span> of the compensations of the &#8220;white voice&#8221;
singer is the fact that she usually possesses a perfect
diction. The voice itself is thrust into the head
cavities and not allowed to vibrate in the face and
mouth and gives ample room for the formation of
vowels and consonants. And the singer with this
voice production usually concentrates her entire
attention on diction.
<p>
<a name="n2r">The</a> cure for this tone emission is, first of all, the
cultivation of the breath prop, then attacking the vowel
sound o o <a href="#n2"><sup>2</sup></a> in the medium voice, which requires a low
position of the larynx, and exercises on the ascending
scale until the higher notes have been brought down,
as it were, and gain some of the body and support of the
lower notes without losing their quality.
<p>
The singer&#8217;s expression must concern itself chiefly
with the play of emotion around the eyes, eyebrows
and forehead. You have no idea how much expression
you can get out of your eyebrows, for instance, until
you study the question and learn by experiment that a
complete emotional scale can be symbolized outwardly
in the movements of the eyelids and eyebrows.
<p>
A very drooping eyebrow is expressive of fatigue,
either physical or mental. This lowered eyelid is the
aspect we see about us most of the time, particularly
on people past their first youth. As it shows a lack of
interest, it is not a favorite expression of actors and is
only employed where the rôle makes it necessary.
<p>
Increasing anxiety is depicted by slanting the eyebrows
obliquely in a downward line toward the nose.
<p>
Concentrated attention draws the eyebrows together
over the bridge of the nose, while furtiveness widens the
space again without elevating the eyebrows.
<p>
In the eyebrows alone you can depict mockery, every
<a name="p32"><u>stage</u></a> <span class="even"><a href="#nav">32</a></span> of anxiety or pain, astonishment, ecstasy, terror,
suffering, fury and admiration, besides all the subtle
tones between.
<p>
In singing rôles of songs it is necessary to practice
before the mirror in order to see that this facial expression
is present and that it is not exaggerated; that the
face is not contorted by lines of suffering or by the lines
of mirth.
<p>
Another thing the young singer must not forget in
making her initial bow before the public is the question
of dress. When singing on the platform or stage, dress
as well as you can. Whenever you face the public
have at least the assurance you are looking your very
best; that your gowns hang well, are well fitted and are
of a becoming color.
<p>
It is not necessary that they should be gorgeous or
expensive, but let them always be suitable, and for big
cities let them be just as sumptuous as you can afford.
At morning concerts in New York, velvets and hand-painted
chiffons are considered good form, while in the
afternoon handsome silk or satin frocks of a very light
color are worn with hats.
<p>
If a singer chooses to wear a hat let her be sure that
its shape will not interfere with her voice.
<p>
A very large hat, for instance, with a wide brim that
comes down over the face, acts as a sort of blanket to
the voice, eating up the sound and detracting from the
beauty of tone, which should go forth into the audience.
It is also likely to shade the singer&#8217;s features
too much and hide her from view from those sitting in
the balconies or galleries. As a rule, the singer&#8217;s hat
should be small or with a flaring brim, which does not
detract from the tone.
<p>
Another word on the subject of corsets. There is
<a name="p33"><u>no</u></a> <span class="odd"><a href="#nav">33</a></span> reason in the world why a singer should not wear
corsets, and if singers have a tendency to grow stout
a corset is usually a necessity. A singer&#8217;s corset
should be especially well fitted around the hips and
should be extremely loose over the diaphragm.
<p>
If made in this way it will not interfere in the
slightest degree with the breath.
<p>
Now as to diet and the general mode of life. Every
singer must take care of her health. But that does not
necessarily mean that she must wrap herself in cotton
batting and lead a sequestered existence. I don&#8217;t
believe that any person who wants to make a public
career can accomplish it and also indulge in social
dissipations. Society must be cut out of the life of the
would-be singer, for the demands made by it on time
and vitality can only be given at a sacrifice to one&#8217;s art.
<p>
The care of the health is an individual matter, and
what agrees well with me would cause others to sicken.
I eat the simplest food always, and naturally, being
an Italian, I prefer the food of my native land. But
simple French or German cookery agrees with me
quite as well. And I allow the tempting pastry, the
rich and overspiced pâté, to pass me by untouched
and console myself with quantities of fruit and fresh
vegetables.
<p>
Personally I never wear a collar and have hardened
my throat to a considerable extent by wearing slightly
cutout gowns always in the house, and even when I
wear furs I do not have them closely drawn around the
neck. I try to keep myself at an even bodily temperature,
and fresh air has been my most potent remedy at
all times when I have been indisposed.</div>

HERE is nothing so beneficial to the young
artist as the kindly and just criticism of a person
who knows and nothing so stimulating as his
praise.
<p>
Among my most priceless possessions I treasure
the words of encouragement given me by Patti and
Sembrich, those wonderful artists, when I was
beginning my career.
<p>
Mme. Patti is a splendid example of the many
sidedness necessary to artistic perfection. Her
wonderful voice was always supplemented by complete
knowledge of the art of singing, and her mastery of
languages and of different fields of art made her not
only a great artist, but a most interesting woman.
<p>
To hear an artist of this kind is one of the most
profitable parts of a musical education.
<p>
But there are two ways of listening to a singer.
There is the appreciative way, and there is the entirely
critical. The beginner usually tries to show her
knowledge by her intensely critical attitude.
<p>
The older you become in your art the more readily
you will be able to appreciate and learn from the
singers you hear on the opera or concert stage.
<p>
The greatest and the humblest singer can teach
you something. But to learn you must be in a receptive
attitude.
<p>
The public has no real conception of what an amount
of intelligent work besides talent and art is necessary
to achieve the results which it sees or hears. Only
those whose lives are devoted to the same ideals can
<a name="p35"><u>understand</u></a> <span class="odd"><a href="#nav">35</a></span> the struggles of other artists, and it is for
that reason that appreciation and not condemnation
should be on the tongues of those who themselves
have studied.
<p>
The artist may demand the greatest things of
herself, and what may be good enough for others
is not good enough for her. As the poet says, &#8220;Art
is long,&#8221; though life may be short, and singing is one
of the most fleeting of all arts, since once the note is
uttered it leaves only a memory in the hearer&#8217;s mind
and since so many beautiful voices, for one reason or
other, go to pieces long before their time.
<p>
If the singer&#8217;s health is good the voice should end
only with life itself, provided, of course, it has been
used with understanding and with art.
<p>
In performing before the public one should be
governed by the tastes of the public, not by one&#8217;s
own tastes. Just as the comedian usually wishes to
play Hamlet and the man of tragic mien thinks he
could be a comedy star, the singer who could make
a fortune at interpreting chansonnettes usually wishes
to sing operatic roles, and the singer with a deep
and heavy voice is longing to inflict baby songs on a
long suffering public.
<p>
It is easy enough to find out what the public wishes
to hear, and, though one should always be enlarging
one&#8217;s repertory, it is not a bad idea to stick to that
field for which one is particularly fitted vocally and
physically.
<p>
In studying a rôle after one has mastered the technical
difficulties one should try to steep one&#8217;s personality
into that of the character one is to portray, and
for that reason all study, no matter what it is, and
reading of all kinds help one in developing a part.
<p>
<a name="p36"><u>The</u></a> <span class="even"><a href="#nav">36</a></span> great Italian tragedienne, Duse, told me that
one of her greatest pleasures was to wander about the
streets incognito watching the types of people, following
them round, observing them in their daily lives
and remembering all the small details of action,
gesture or expression which she could some day
embody into a rôle.
<p>
The more one sees and studies people with sympathy,
the more points one gets for the study of life which is
embodied in the art one gives forth. But it is sympathy
with one&#8217;s fellow beings and kindly observation
which help one here, never the critical attitude.
<p>
An artist can only afford to be coldly critical toward
his own work and not toward the work of others.
<p>
Recently a young woman who started her vocal
career as a contralto has sung the most difficult of
Wagnerian soprano parts. Her high notes, it is true,
were not the high notes of a natural soprano voice,
but the care and perfection with which each high
note was attacked were worthy of closest attention
and admiration and defied criticism.
<p>
Hearing the smaller singers, the beginners who
are still struggling with their art, should awaken in
the heart of the intelligent listener not contemptuous
criticism, but should be one means of realizing one&#8217;s
own vocal defects and the possible ways of overcoming
them.
<p>
There are bad singing teachers, of course, but often
the pupils are worse and will not listen to advice. The
large and shrieking voice usually belongs to this type
of pupil, for it is easier to force the voice when the
temperament is robust and the vocal cords equally
strong than it is to learn gently and quietly the correct
and natural position in voice placement, and it is
<a name="p37"><u>easier</u></a> <span class="odd"><a href="#nav">37</a></span> to make a noise as best you can than to use
intelligently the different resonance cavities for the
blending of the perfect tone.
<p>
Another fault severely criticised in the youthful
singer is a lack of correct pronunciation or diction.
It is only after the voice is perfectly controlled that
the lips and tongue can function freely for the
pronunciation of syllables.
<p>
While the voice is in what might be called a state
of ferment the singer is only anxious to produce tones,
and diction slips by the wayside. The appreciative
listener should be able to know whether a lack of
diction on the singer&#8217;s part means immaturity or
simply slovenliness.
<p>
Still another fault in voice production is the tremolo.
It is the overambitious singer, the singer who forces
a small, light organ to do heavy work, who develops
the tremolo.
<p>
The tremolo is a sure sign that the vocal chords
have been stretched beyond their natural limits, and
there is only one thing can cure this. That is absolute
rest for some time and then beginning the study of
the voice, first singing with the mouth closed and
relying entirely on very gentle breath pressure for
the production of the sound.
<p>
The pupil suffering from tremolo or even very
strong vibrato must have courage to stop at once and
to forego having a big voice. After all, the most
beautiful voices in the world are not necessarily the
biggest voices, and certainly the tremolo is about
the worst fault a singer can have. But that, like
almost any other vocal defect, can be cured by
persistent effort of the right kind.
<p>
In singing in public as well as when practicing the
<a name="p38"><u>singer</u></a> <span class="even"><a href="#nav">38</a></span> must stand so that the body will be perfectly
and firmly poised. One should always stand in such
a position as to be able to inhale comfortably and
control a large breath, to allow the throat absolute
freedom, with the head sufficiently raised to let the
inflowing air penetrate all the resonance cavities.
<p>
The great thing to avoid is stiffness or discomfort
of any kind in the pose. At the same time one must
have a gracious air, and while feeling perfectly solidly
poised on the feet, must make the impression of a
certain lightness and freedom from all bodily restraint.
<p>
I have not meant in these short articles to give you
anything but a very general idea of the salient points
of the art of singing. After all, each one must do the
real work herself.
<p>
The road is full of discouragements and hardships,
but there is always something new and interesting
to learn, and to achieve success, whether for the
public or merely for the home circle, is worth all the
trouble one can take. And so I wish you all success.</div>

<span class="caps">How a Neapolitan Mechanic&#8217;s Son Became the<br>
World&#8217;s Greatest Tenor</span>
</center>

<div class="book">
<br>
<span class="dropcap">E</span>
<p class="dropcap">
NRICO CARUSO enjoys the reputation of being
the greatest tenor since Italo Campanini. The
latter was the legitimate successor of Brignoli,
an artist whose wonderful singing made his uncouth
stage presence a matter of little moment. Caruso&#8217;s
voice at its best recalls Brignoli to the veteran opera
habitué. It possesses something of the dead tenor&#8217;s
sweetness and clarity in the upper register, but it lacks
the delicacy and artistic finish of Campanini&#8217;s supreme
effort, although it is vastly more magnetic and thrill
inspiring.
<p>
That Caruso is regarded as the foremost living tenor
is made good by the fact that he is the highest priced
male artist in the world. Whenever and wherever he
sings multitudes flock to hear him, and no one goes
away unsatisfied. He is constantly the recipient of
ovations which demonstrate the power of his minstrelsy,
and his lack of especial physical attractiveness
is no bar to the witchery of his voice.
<p>
Caruso is a Neapolitan and is now thirty-five years of
age. Unlike so many great Italian tenors, he is not of
peasant parentage. His father was a skilled mechanic
who had been put in charge of the warehouses of a large
banking and importing concern. As a lad Enrico used
to frequent the docks in the vicinity of these warehouses
and became an expert swimmer at a very early age. In
those halcyon days his burning ambition was to be a
<a name="p40"><u>sailor</u></a>, <span class="even"><a href="#nav">40</a></span> and he had a profound distaste for his father&#8217;s
plan to have him learn a trade.
<p>
At the age of ten he was still a care free and fun loving
boy, without a thought beyond the docks and their life.
It was then that his father ruled that since he would not
become a mechanic he must be sent to school. He had
already learned to read a little, but that was all. He
was sent to a day school in the neighborhood, and he
accepted the restraint with such bad grace that he was
in almost constant disgrace. His long association with
the water front had made him familiar with the art of
physical defense, and he was in frequent trouble on
that account.
<p>
The head master of the school was a musician, and
he discovered one day that his unruly pupil could sing.
He was an expert in the development of the boy soprano
and he soon realized that in young Caruso he had a
veritable treasure. He was shrewd enough to keep his
discovery to himself for some time, for he determined to
profit by the boy&#8217;s extraordinary ability. The lad was
rehearsed privately and was stimulated to further effort
by the promise of sweetmeats and release from school
duties. Finally the unscrupulous master made
engagements for the young prodigy to sing at fashionable
weddings and concerts, but he always pocketed the
money which came from these public appearances.
<p>
At the end of the second year, when Caruso was twelve
years of age, he decided that he had had enough of the
school, and he made himself so disagreeable to the head
master that he was sent home in disgrace. His irate
father gave him a sound thrashing and declared that he
must be apprenticed to a mechanical engineer. The
boy took little interest in his new work, but showed some
aptitude for mechanical drawing and caligraphy. In a
<a name="p41"><u>few</u></a> <span class="odd"><a href="#nav">41</a></span> months he became so interested in sketching that
he began to indulge in visions of becoming a great
artist.
<p>
When he was fifteen his mother died, and, since he
had kept at the mechanical work solely on her account,
he now announced his intention of forsaking engineering
and devoting himself to art and music. When
his father heard of this open rebellion he fell into a
great rage and declared that he would have no more of
him, that he was a disgrace to the family and that he
need not show his face at home.
<p>
So Caruso became a wanderer, with nothing in his
absolute possession save a physique that was perfect
and an optimism that was never failing. He picked up
a scanty livelihood by singing at church festivals and
private entertainments and in time became known
widely as the most capable boy soprano in Naples.
Money came more plentifully, and he was able to live
generously. In a short time his voice was transformed
into a marvelous alto, and he soon found himself in
great demand and was surfeited with attention from the
rich and powerful. It was about this time that King
Edward, then Prince of Wales, heard him sing in a
Neapolitan church and was so delighted that he invited
the boy to go to England, an invitation which young
Caruso did not accept. Now that he had &#8220;arrived&#8221;
Naples was good enough for him.
<p>
One day something happened which plunged him into
the deepest despair. Without a warning of any sort his
beautiful alto voice disappeared, leaving in its place only
the feeblest and most unmusical of croaks. He was so
overcome at his loss that he shut himself up in his room
and would see no one. It was the first great affliction
he had ever known, and he admits that he meditated
<a name="p42"><u>suicide</u></a>. <span class="even"><a href="#nav">42</a></span> He had made many friends, and some of them
would have been glad to comfort him, but his grief
would admit of no partnership.
<p>
One evening when he was skulking along an obscure
highway, at the very bottom of the well of his despair,
a firm hand was laid on his shoulder and a cheery voice
called out: &#8220;Whither so fast? Come home with me,
poor little shaver!&#8221;
<p>
It was Messiani, the famous baritone, who had always
felt an interest in the boy and who would not release
him in spite of his vigorous efforts to escape. The big
baritone took him to his lodging and when he had
succeeded in cheering the unhappy lad into a momentary
forgetfulness of his misery asked him to sing.
<p>
&#8220;But I can&#8217;t,&#8221; sobbed Caruso. &#8220;It has gone!&#8221;
<p>
Messiani went to the piano and struck a chord. The
weeping boy piped up in a tone so thin and feeble that it
was almost indistinguishable.
<p>
&#8220;Louder!&#8221; yelled the big singer, with another full
chord. Caruso obeyed and kept on through the scale.
Then Messiani jumped up from the piano stool, seized
the astonished boy about the waist and raised him high
off his feet, at the same time yelling at the top of his
voice: &#8220;What a little jackass! What a little idiot!&#8221;
<p>
Almost bursting with rage, for the miserable boy
thought his friend was making sport of him, Caruso
searched the apartment for some weapon with which he
might avenge himself. Seizing a heavy brass candlestick,
he hurled it at Messiani with all his force, but it
missed the baritone and landed in a mirror.
<p>
&#8220;Hold, madman!&#8221; interposed the startled singer.
&#8220;Your voice is not gone. It is magnificent. You will
be the tenor of the century.&#8221;
<p>
Messiani sent him to Vergine, then the most
cele<a name="p43"><u>brated</u></a> <span class="odd"><a href="#nav">43</a></span> trainer of the voice in Italy. The maestro was
not so enthusiastic as Messiani, but he promised to do
what he could. He offered to instruct Caruso four
years, only demanding 25 per cent. of his pupil&#8217;s
receipts for his first five years in opera. Caruso signed
such a contract willingly, although he realized afterward
that he was the victim of a veritable Shylock.
<p>
When Vergine was through with the young tenor he
dismissed him without lavish commendation, but with
a reminder of the terms of his contract. Caruso
obtained an engagement in Naples, but did not achieve
marked success at once. On every payday Vergine
was on hand to receive his percentage. His regularity
finally attracted the attention of the manager, and he
made inquiry of Caruso. The young tenor showed him
his copy of the contract and was horrified to be told that
he had bound himself to his Shylock for a lifetime; that
the contract read that he was to give Vergine five years
of actual singing. Caruso would have reached the age
of fifty before the last payment came. The matter was
finally adjusted by the courts, and the unscrupulous
teacher lost 200,000 lire by the judgment.
<p>
In Italy every man must serve his time in the army,
and Caruso was checked in his operatic career by the call
to go into barracks. Not long, however, was he compelled
to undergo the tedium of army life. In consideration
of his art he was permitted to offer his brother
as a substitute after two months, and he returned to the
opera. He was engaged immediately for a season at
Caserta, and from that time his rise has been steady and
unimpeded. After singing in one Italian city after another
he went to Egypt and thence to Paris, where he
made a favorable impression. A season in Berlin followed,
but the Wagner influence was dominant, and he
<a name="p44"><u>did</u></a> <span class="even"><a href="#nav">44</a></span> not succeed in restoring the supremacy of Italian
opera. The next season was spent in South America,
and in the new world Caruso made his first triumph.
From Rio he went to London, and on his first appearance
he captured his Covent Garden audience. When he made
his first appearance in the United States he was already
at the top of the operatic ladder, and, although many
attempts to dislodge him have been made, he stands still
on the topmost rung.</div>

<br>
<span class="dropcap">O</span>
<p class="dropcap">
F the thousands of people who visit the opera
during the season few outside of the small
proportion of the initiated realize how much the
performance of the singer whom they see and hear on
the stage is dependent on previous rehearsal, constant
practice and watchfulness over the physical conditions
that preserve that most precious of our assets, the voice.
<p>
Nor does this same great public in general know of
what the singer often suffers in the way of nervousness
or stage fright before appearing in front of the footlights,
nor that his life, outwardly so fêted and brilliant,
is in private more or less of a retired, ascetic one and
that his social pleasures must be strictly limited.
<p>
These conditions, of course, vary greatly with the
individual singer, but I will try to tell in the following
articles, as exemplified in my own case, what a great
responsibility a voice is when one considers that it is the
great God-given treasure which brings us our fame and
fortune.
<p>
I am perhaps more favored than many in the fact
that my voice was always &#8220;there,&#8221; and that, with
proper cultivation, of course, I have not had to overstrain
it in the attempt to reach vocal heights which
have come to some only after severe and long-continued
effort. But, on the other hand, the finer the natural
voice the more sedulous the care required to preserve
it in its pristine freshness to bloom. This is the
singer&#8217;s ever present problem&#8212;in my case, however,
mostly a matter of common sense living.
<p>
As regards eating&#8212;a rather important item, by the
<a name="p46"><u>way</u></a>&#8212;I <span class="even"><a href="#nav">46</a></span> have kept to the light &#8220;continental&#8221; breakfast,
which I do not take too early; then a rather substantial
luncheon toward two o&#8217;clock. My native macaroni,
specially prepared by my chef, who is engaged particularly
for his ability in this way, is often a feature in this
midday meal. I incline toward the simpler and more
nourishing food, though my tastes are broad in the
matter, but lay particular stress on the excellence of
the cooking, for one cannot afford to risk one&#8217;s health
on indifferently cooked food, no matter what its quality.
<p>
On the nights when I sing I take nothing after
luncheon, except perhaps a sandwich and a glass of
Chianti, until after the performance, when I have a
supper of whatever I fancy within reasonable bounds.
Being blessed with a good digestion, I have not been
obliged to take the extraordinary precautions about
what I eat that some singers do. Still, I am careful
never to indulge to excess in the pleasures of the table,
for the condition of our alimentary apparatus and that
of the vocal chords are very closely related, and the
unhealthy state of the one immediately reacts on the
other.
<p>
My reason for abstaining from food for so long before
singing may be inquired. It is simply that when the
large space required by the diaphragm in expanding to
take in breath is partly occupied by one&#8217;s dinner the
result is that one cannot take as deep a breath as one
would like and consequently the tone suffers and the
all-important ease of breathing is interfered with. In
addition a certain amount of bodily energy is used in
the process of digestion which would otherwise be
entirely given to the production of the voice.
<p>
These facts, seemingly so simple, are very vital ones
to a singer, particularly on an &#8220;opening night.&#8221; A
<a name="p47"><u>singer&#8217;s</u></a> <span class="odd"><a href="#nav">47</a></span> life is such an active one, with rehearsals and
performances, that not much opportunity is given for
&#8220;exercise,&#8221; and the time given to this must, of course,
be governed by individual needs. I find a few simple
physical exercises in the morning after rising, somewhat
similar to those practiced in the army, or the use for
a few minutes of a pair of light dumbbells, very beneficial.
Otherwise I must content myself with an occasional
automobile ride. One must not forget, however,
that the exercise of singing, with its constant deep
inhalation (and acting in itself is considerable exercise
also), tends much to keep one from acquiring an
oversupply of embonpoint.
<p>
A proper moderation in eating, however, as I have
already said, will contribute as much to the maintenance
of correct proportion in one&#8217;s figure as any amount of
voluntary exercise which one only goes through with
on principle.
<p>
As so many of you in a number of States of this
great country are feeling and expressing as well as voting
opinions on the subject of whether one should or should
not drink intoxicants, you may inquire what practice is
most in consonance with a singer&#8217;s well being, in my
opinion. Here, again, of course, customs vary with the
individual. In Italy we habitually drink the light
wines of the country with our meals and surely are
never the worse for it. I have retained my fondness
for my native Chianti, which I have even made on my
own Italian estate, but believe and carry out the belief
that moderation is the only possible course. I am inclined
to condemn the use of spirits, whisky in particular,
which is so prevalent in the Anglo-Saxon countries,
for it is sure to inflame the delicate little ribbons of
tissue which produce the singing tone and
then&#8212;<i>addio</i> to a clear and ringing high C!
<p>
<a name="p48"><u>Though</u></a> <span class="even"><a href="#nav">48</a></span> I indulge occasionally in a cigarette, I advise
all singers, particularly young singers, against this
practice, which can certainly not fail to have a bad
effect on the delicate lining of the throat, the vocal
chords and the lungs.
<p>
You will see by all the foregoing that even the gift of
a good breath is not to be abused or treated lightly, and
that the &#8220;goose with the golden egg&#8221; must be most
carefully nurtured.
<p>
Outside of this, however, one of the great temptations
that beset any singer of considerable fame is the
many social demands that crowd upon him, usually
unsought and largely undesired. Many of the invitations
to receptions, teas and dinners are from comparative
strangers and cannot be considered, but of those from
one&#8217;s friends which it would be a pleasure to attend
very few indeed can be accepted, for the singer&#8217;s first
care, even if a selfish one, must be for his health and
consequently his voice, and the attraction of social
intercourse must, alas, be largely foregone.
<p>
The continual effort of loud talking in a throng would
be extremely bad for the sensitive musical instrument
that the vocalist carries in his throat, and the various
beverages offered at one of your afternoon teas it
would be too difficult to refuse. So I confine myself to
an occasional quiet dinner with a few friends on an off
night at the opera or any evening at the play, where I
can at least be silent during the progress of the acts.
<p>
In common with most of the foreign singers who come
to America, I have suffered somewhat from the effects
of your barbarous climate, with its sudden changes of
temperature, but perhaps have become more
accustomed to it in the years of my operatic work here.
What has affected me most, however, is the overheating
<a name="p49"><u>of</u></a> <span class="odd"><a href="#nav">49</a></span> the houses and hotels with that dry steam heat
which is so trying to the throat. Even when I took a
house for the season I had difficulty in keeping the air
moist. Now, however, in the very modern and
excellent hotel where I am quartered they have a new
system of ventilation by which the air is automatically
rendered pure and the heat controlled&#8212;a great blessing
to the over-sensitive vocalist.
<p>
After reading the above the casual person will perhaps
believe that a singer&#8217;s life is really not a bit of a sinecure,
even when he has attained the measure of this world&#8217;s
approval and applause afforded by the &#8220;great horseshoe.&#8221;</div>

HE question, &#8220;How is it done?&#8221; as applied to the
art of singing brings up so many different points
that it is difficult to know where to begin or
how to give the layman in any kind of limited space a
concise idea of the principles controlling the production
of the voice and their application to vocal art.
<p>
Every singer or singing master is popularly supposed
to have a method by following out which he has come
to fame. Yet if asked to describe this method many
an artist would be at a loss to do so, or else deny that
he had any specific method at all, such a subtle and
peculiarly individual matter it is that constitutes the
technical part of singing. Most singers&#8212;in fact, all of
them&#8212;do many things in singing habitually, yet so
inconspicuously that they could not describe how or
why they did them. Yet this little set of &#8220;artistic&#8221;
habits all arise from most logical causes and have
become habits from their fitness to the personality of
their owner and their special value in enabling that
singer to do his best work by their aid. For instance,
a singer will know from trials and experience just the
proper position of the tongue and larynx to produce
most effectively a certain note on the scale, yet he will
have come by this knowledge not by theory and reasoning,
but simply oft repeated attempts, and the knowledge
he has come by will be valuable to him only, for
somebody else would produce the same note equally
well, but in quite a different way.
<p>
So one may see that there are actually as many
methods as there are singers, and any particular method,
<a name="p51"><u>even</u></a> <span class="odd"><a href="#nav">51</a></span> if accurately set forth, might be useless to the
person who tried it. This is what I really would reply
to anyone putting this question to me&#8212;that my own
particular way of singing, if I have any, is, after all,
peculiarly suited to me only, as I have above described.
<p>
However, there are many interesting and valuable
things to be said about the voice in a general way.
<p>
Speaking first of the classification of voices, many
young singers are put much in doubt and dilemma
because they are unable to determine what sort of voice
they really possess, whether soprano, mezzo or contralto.
Of course, it is easy enough to distinguish between
the extremes of these, between a &#8220;real&#8221; tenor
and a low bass, but the difference between a high baritone
and tenor is rather more difficult to discern, and
a young man studying has often been at great disadvantage
by imagining, for instance, that he had a tenor
voice and trying constantly to sing music too high for
him, since he in reality had only a high baritone.
<p>
In the course of development a voice very often
increases its range and changes its quality sufficiently to
pass from a baritone to a tenor, and it is sometimes a
problem to place it during the transition process. Perhaps
the surest way to determine the real character of
a voice is to see on what notes words can be most easily
pronounced. For the average tenor the notes up to
A above middle C, for the baritone, D above middle C,
and for the bass up to middle C itself, can be pronounced
on the best.
<p>
One should never try to change the tessitura, or
natural character of the voice. A voice will become
higher just when it should by the development due to
rational work and never by forcing it. Nothing is
easier than to force a voice upward or downward, but
<a name="p52"><u>to</u></a> <span class="even"><a href="#nav">52</a></span> cause it to &#8220;recede,&#8221; as it were, in either direction,
is another matter. A baritone who tries to increase
his upper range by main strength will surely in time
lose his best lower notes, and a light tenor who attempts
to force out notes lower than his range will never be
able to sing legitimate tenor roles, and after two or three
years may not be able to sing at all.
<p>
It may be well to speak now of a very important
point in singing&#8212;what is called the &#8220;attack&#8221; of the
tone. In general this may be described as the relative
position of the throat and tongue and the quality of
voice as the tone is begun. The most serious fault of
many singers is that they attack the tone either from
the chest or the throat. Even with robust health the
finest voice cannot resist this. This is the reason one
sees so many artists who have made a brilliant debut
disappear from sight very soon or wind up later on a
mediocre career. Singers who use their voices properly
should be at the height of their talents at forty-five and
keep their voices in full strength and virility up to at
least fifty. At this latter age, or close after it, it would
seem well to have earned the right to close one&#8217;s career.
<p>
A great artist ought to have the dignity to say farewell
to his public when still in full possession of his
powers and never let the world apprise him of his falling
off.
<p>
To have the attack true and pure one must consciously
try to open the throat not only in front, but from behind,
for the throat is the door through which the voice
must pass, and if it is not sufficiently open it is useless
to attempt to get out a full, round one; also the throat is
the outlet and inlet for the breath, and if it is closed the
voice will seek other channels or return quenched within.
<p>
It must not be imagined that to open the mouth wide
<a name="p53"><u>will</u></a> <span class="odd"><a href="#nav">53</a></span> do the same for the throat. If one is well versed
in the art, one can open the throat perfectly without
a perceptible opening of the mouth, merely by the
power of respiration.
<p>
It is necessary to open the sides of the mouth, at the
same time dropping the chin well, to obtain good throat
opening. In taking higher notes, of course, one must open
the mouth a little wider, but for the most part the
position of the mouth is that assumed when smiling.
It is a good idea to practice opening the throat before
a mirror and try to see the palate, as when you show
your throat to a doctor.
<p>
In pronouncing the sound &#8220;ah&#8221; one must always
attack it in the back part of the throat, taking care,
however, before uttering the syllable, to have the
throat well open; otherwise what is called &#8220;stroke of
the glottis&#8221; occurs and the tone formed is hard and
disagreeable. If you ever hear this stroke of glottis on
the attack, you may know that the singer did not attack
far enough back in the throat.
<p>
The tone once launched, one must think how it may
be properly sustained, and this is where the art of
breathing is most concerned. The lungs, in the first
place, should be thoroughly filled. A tone begun with
only half filled lungs loses half its authority and is very
apt to be false in pitch. To take a full breath properly,
the chest must be raised at the same moment the
abdomen sinks in. Then with the gradual expulsion of
the breath a contrary movement takes place. The
diaphragm and elastic tissue surrounding and containing
the stomach and vital organs and the muscles surrounding,
by practice acquire great strength and assist considerably
in this process of respiration and are vital
factors in the matter of controlling the supply which
<a name="p54"><u>supports</u></a> <span class="even"><a href="#nav">54</a></span> the tone. The diaphragm is really like a pair
of bellows and serves exactly the same purpose. It
is this ability to take in an adequate supply of breath
and to retain it until required that makes or, by
contrary, mars all singing. A singer with a perfect sense
of pitch and all the good intentions possible will often
sing off the key and bring forth a tone with no vitality
to it, distressing to hear, simply for lack of breath control.
<p>
This art of respiration once acquired, the student has
gone a considerable step on the road to Parnassus.
<p>
To practice deep breathing effectively it is an excellent
plan to breathe through the nose, which aids in
keeping the confined breath from escaping too soon.
The nose also warms and filters the air, making it much
more agreeable to the lungs than if taken directly
through the mouth. In the practice of slow breathing
make sure that the lungs are as nearly emptied as possible
on the expulsion of the breath before beginning a
new inspiration, as this gives extra impetus to the fresh
supply of air and strengthens all the breathing muscles.
<p>
If this is not done, moreover, the effect is like two
people trying to get in and out of the same narrow door
at the same time.
<p>
The voice is naturally divided into three registers&#8212;the
chest, medium and head. In a man&#8217;s voice of lower
quality this last is known as &#8220;falsetto,&#8221; but in the case
of a tenor he may use a tone which in sound is almost
falsetto, but is really a mezza voce, or half voice. This
latter legitimately belongs to a man&#8217;s compass; a falsetto
does not. The most important register is the medium,
particularly of tenors, for this includes the greater part
of the tenor&#8217;s voice and can be utilized even to the top
of his range if rightly produced.
<p>
<a name="p55"><u>In</u></a> <span class="odd"><a href="#nav">55</a></span> the matter of taking high notes one should remember
that their purity and ease of production depend
very much on the way the preceding notes leading up
to them are sung. Beginning in the lower register and
attacking the ascending notes well back, a balance must
be maintained all the way up, so that the highest note
receives the benefit and support of the original position
of the throat, and there is no danger, consequently, of
the throat closing and pinching the quality of the top
notes.
<p>
Singers, especially tenors, are very apt to throw the
head forward in producing the high notes, and
consequently get that throaty, strained voice which is so
disagreeable. To avoid this one should try to keep the
supply of breath down as far toward the abdomen as
possible, thus maintaining the upper passages to the
head quite free for the emission of the voice. Remember
also to sing within yourself, as it were&#8212;to feel the
tones all through your being; otherwise your singing
will possess no sentiment, emotion or authority. It
is the failure to accomplish this which has produced so
many soulless artists&#8212;singers endowed with magnificent
voices, capable of surmounting every technical
difficulty, but devoid of that charm of intonation which
is so vital to success on the operatic stage.</div>

<p class="dropcap">
&nbsp;HAVE previously mentioned mezza voce and will
now say a word on this subject, for the artistic
use of the &#8220;half voice&#8221; is a very valuable adjunct
in all singing. It may be defined simply as the natural
voice produced softly, but with an extra strength of
breath. It is this breathy quality, however&#8212;which
one must be careful never to exaggerate or the tone
will not carry&#8212;that gives that velvety effect to the tone
that is so delightful.
<p>
Mezza voce is just a concentration of the full voice,
and it requires, after all, as much breath support.
A soft note which is taken with the &#8220;head voice&#8221;
without being supported by a breath taken from the
diaphragm is a helpless sort of thing. It does not
carry and is inaudible at any distance, whereas the soft
note which does possess the deep breath support is
penetrating, concentrated and most expressive.
<p>
Another important point is that, with a &#8220;piano&#8221; note
properly taken in the register which is proper to it, there
is no danger of having to change the position of the
throat and consequently the real character of the note
when making a crescendo and again diminishing it.
It will be the same note continuing to sound.
<p>
On the other hand, with a soft note taken in a register
foreign to it, as soon as its strength is augmented the
register must suddenly be changed and the result is like
a Tyrolean yodel.
<p>
So remember in a mezza voce to see that the register
is right and to use a double breath strength. I speak
of the matter of register here for the benefit of those who
<a name="p57"><u>must</u></a> <span class="odd"><a href="#nav">57</a></span> keep this constantly in mind. I myself have been
blessed with what is called a naturally placed voice,
and never had trouble with the mezza voce. The
majority of Italian singers come to it easily.
<p>
There are a number of wrong sorts of voices which
should be mentioned to be shunned&#8212;the &#8220;white&#8221;
voice, the &#8220;throaty&#8221; voice, the &#8220;nasal&#8221; voice, and the
&#8220;bleat.&#8221; The nasal quality is the most difficult to
correct. Many teachers, especially the French, make
a point of placing the voice in the nasal cavity on the
pretext of strengthening it, and this nasal quality,
partly on account of the sound of many of the French
words, is only too prevalent. The voice, however, can
only be strengthened by legitimate means; otherwise it
can easily be ruined. One can breathe through the
nose, but never attack or sing through it.
<p>
The &#8220;white voice&#8221; (voce bianca) is a head voice
without deep support and consequently without color;
hence its appellation. One can learn to avoid it by
practicing with the mouth closed and by taking care to
breathe through the nose, which forces the respiration
to descend to the abdomen.
<p>
The &#8220;throaty&#8221; voice comes from singing with the
throat insufficiently opened, so that the breath does not
pass easily through the nose and head cavities and,
again, from not attacking the tone deeply enough.
<p>
To cure oneself of this throaty quality attack your
notes from the abdomen, the mouth well open, standing
in front of a mirror. The force of the respiration will
keep the tongue depressed and the throat will remain
free.
<p>
As for the fault of nasality, it is, as I have said, the
most difficult to get rid of. Sometimes one never does
lose it. The only remedy is what I have previously
<a name="p58"><u>indicated</u></a><span class="even"><a href="#nav">58</a></span>&#8212;to attack from the abdomen, with the
throat open, and carry the voice over the soft palate,
for if the voice is placed in the nose it indicates that one
is singing too far forward, which is against the rules of
song. If the student has a tendency to sing in this way
it is well to practice in vowel sounds only (ah-eh-ee-la-lay-lee,
etc.) in order to be cured of this serious fault.
<p>
After all, however, those who have practiced the art
of right breathing need have none of the defects
mentioned above.
<p>
The &#8220;bleat&#8221; or goat voice, a particular fault of
French singers, proceeds from the habit of forcing the
voice, which, when it is of small volume, cannot stand
the consequent fatigue of the larynx. Many singers
with voices suitable only for light opera are constantly
trying to branch out into big dramatic arias. Such
performances are assuredly distressing to hear and are
certainly disastrous for the voices concerned. It is no
wonder that these people are often ill, for one cannot
make such efforts without injuring the health. I
realize that they often do it to please their directors and
to be obliging in an emergency, but when they are down
and out others will easily replace them and they are
heard from no more.
<p>
To keep the voice fresh for the longest possible time
one should not only never overstep his vocal &#8220;means,&#8221;
but should limit his output as he does the expenses of
his purse.
<p>
There is only one way to cure a bleaty voice, and that
is to cultivate an absolute rest; then, on taking up singing
again, to use the &#8220;closed mouth&#8221; method until the
time the strength of respiration shall be such that one
can open his mouth and let the restored voice take its
course.
<p>
<a name="p59"><u>A</u></a> <span class="odd"><a href="#nav">59</a></span> few words on practicing with closed mouth may
here be appropriate. This method of study is really
all that is necessary to place certain voices, but is bad
for others. It all depends on the formation of the
mouth and throat. For example, a singer troubled
with the fault of closing the throat too much should
never work with the mouth closed. When one can do
it safely, however, it is a most excellent resource for
preparatory exercises in respiration. Since, as I have
already explained, breathing through the nose with
closed mouth throws back the respiration to the abdomen,
it is best to do the exercise seated in a comfortable,
natural position.
<p>
Vocal work with closed mouth is also a powerful
auxiliary to vocal agility. Many great artists perform
their daily vocal exercises with the mouth shut, and I
can personally testify to the excellency of this practice.
It most certainly strengthens the breathing powers and
at the same time rests the voice. But one should know
how to do it properly. I know of many badly fatigued
voices that have been restored to their normal
condition in this way.
<p>
Singers, of all musicians, have the reputation of
displaying the least regard for time. In operatic work,
however, with an orchestra to follow or be followed, it is
especially essential to observe a sane respect for the
proper tempo. Otherwise one is liable to get into
immediate trouble with the conductor. Of course I do
not mean that one should sing in a mechanical way and
give nothing of one&#8217;s own personality. This would
naturally rob the music of all charm. There are many
singers who cannot or will not count the time properly.
There are those who sing without method, who do not
fit their breathing, which is really the regulator of
<a name="p60"><u>vocal</u></a> <span class="even"><a href="#nav">60</a></span> performance, to the right periods, and who
consequently are never in time. They make all kinds of
rallentandos where they are not necessary, to gain time
to recover the breath that they have not taken when
they should. It is not enough to give the notes their
full value. The rests, above all, should be carefully
observed in order to have sufficient opportunity to get
a good breath and prepare for the next phrase. It is
this exactitude that gives certainty to one&#8217;s rendition
and authority in singing&#8212;something many artists do
not possess. A singer may make all the efforts he desires
and still keep the time, and he <em>must</em> keep it.
<p>
Those who roar most loudly rarely sing in time.
They give every thought to the volume of tone they are
producing and do not bother themselves about
anything else. The right accents in music depend very
much on the exact time. Tone artists, while still
making all their desired &#8220;effects&#8221; in apparent freedom
of style and delivery, nevertheless do not ever lose
sight of the time. Those who do are usually apt to be
amateurs and are not to be imitated.</div>

<p class="dropcap">
OOD diction, or the art of pronouncing the
words of a song or opera properly and
intelligently, is a matter sadly neglected by many
singers, and indeed is not considered important by a
large proportion of the audiences in this country, who
do not understand foreign language, at any rate. And
in an opera sung in a language unknown to most of the
audience it is apparently unimportant whether the
words are understood or not as long as there is a general
knowledge of the plot, and the main consideration is,
of course, the music.
<p>
Yet for those who are conversant with the language
in which the opera is written, how common an experience
it is (in concert, also) to be able, in spite of their
linguistic knowledge, to understand little of what is
being sung, and what a drawback this really is! How
many singers there are who seem to turn all their attention
to the production of beautiful sounds and neglect
in most cases the words that often are equally
beautiful, or should be!
<p>
One hears a great deal just now about the advisability
of giving operas in the native language, as it is
done in France and Germany, and the idea would seem
to have its advantages, as has already been demonstrated
in some excellent performances of German,
French and Italian operas in English. But of what
avail would such a project be if, after all, one could not
understand the words of his own language as they were
sung?
<p>
The language might as well be Sanskrit or Chinese.
<p>
<a name="p62"><u>In</u></a> <span class="even"><a href="#nav">62</a></span> France the matter of diction is probably given the
greatest attention, and singers at the Opera Comique,
for instance, are noted for their pure and distinct
enunciation of every syllable. Indeed, it is as much of a
sine qua non there as good singing, if not more so, and
the numerous subtleties in the French language are
difficult enough to justify this special stress laid upon
correct pronunciation.
<p>
It requires a very particular ability in a foreigner to
attain the atmosphere of perfect French to any very
high degree. Italian is generally considered an easier
language to pronounce in song, as indeed it is, all the
vowel sounds being full and sonorous and lacking that
&#8220;covered&#8221; or mixed quality so often occurring in the
French. Nevertheless, Italian has its difficulties,
particularly in the way of distinctly enunciating the double
consonants and proper division of the liaisons, or combining
of final vowels with initial vowels, and the correct
amount of softness to be given to the letter C.
<p>
All this, of course, is from the standpoint of those
to whom these languages are foreign.
<p>
Certainly no singer can be called a great artist unless
his diction is good, for a beautiful voice alone will not
make up for other deficiencies. A singer endowed with
a small voice or even one of not very pleasing quality
can give more pleasure than a singer possessing a big,
impressive voice, but no diction.
<p>
Some people claim that a pronunciation too distinct
or too much insisted upon spoils the real voice quality,
but this should not be the case if the words are correctly
and naturally brought out. Doubtless, this impression
has come from the fact that, particularly in France,
many singers possessed of small voices must exaggerate
their diction to obtain their effects. But if they did
<a name="p63"><u>not</u></a> <span class="odd"><a href="#nav">63</a></span> have this perfect diction they often would have
little else to recommend them. I would aver that a
fine enunciation, far from interfering with it, aids the
voice production, makes it softer and more concentrated,
but diction should act rather as a frame for the
voice and never replace it.
<p>
Each of the three languages, French, German and
Italian, has its peculiar characteristics, which are of
aid to the student in the general study of pronunciation,
and it is well to have a knowledge of them all outside of
the fact that an artist nowadays needs to have this
knowledge in order not only to rank with the greatest,
but to cope with the demands of an operatic career.
<p>
The Italian language in its very essence is rich in
vowels and vowel combinations, from which comes
principally the color in tones, and it has consequently
been called the &#8220;language of song.&#8221; Italians thus have
naturally what it is so much trouble for singers of other
nations to acquire&#8212;the numerous variations of vowel
sounds.
<p>
French has the nasal sounds as its dominating
characteristic and is very valuable in the cultivation of
&#8220;nasal resonance.&#8221;
<p>
As I said before, it is so easy to exaggerate and the
voice is so apt to get too much &#8220;in the nose&#8221; that one
has to be extremely careful in the use of the French &#8220;n&#8221;
and &#8220;ng.&#8221;
<p>
German is so full of consonants that one needs to
have exceptional control of the tongue and lips to give
their proper value.
<p>
English possesses the features of all the other
languages&#8212;of course, in less marked degree&#8212;resembling
most, perhaps, the German. The &#8220;th&#8221; is the most
difficult sound to make effective in singing.
<p>
<a name="p64"><u>I</u></a> <span class="even"><a href="#nav">64</a></span> have already spoken of the various phases of
nervousness which an artist feels before the performance,
but I wish to say here a word in regard to the practical
significance of such nervousness. Artists who do not
experience it are those who lack real genius. There
are really two kinds of fear&#8212;that arising from a realization
of the importance of what is to be done, the other
from a lack of confidence in one&#8217;s power. If a singer
has no conscience in his performance he is never
nervous, but full of assurance.
<p>
It is seldom that true artists are much troubled with
nervousness after going upon the stage. Generally, as
I have before mentioned, they are apt to be ill during
the day of the performance, but before the public they
forget everything and are dominated only by the real
love of their art and sustained by the knowledge of
possessing a proper &#8220;method.&#8221;
<p>
It is certain with a good breath support even nervousness
need not prevent one from singing well, although
one may be actually suffering from trepidation. Yet
we know that sometimes the greatest of artists are
prevented thus from doing their best work. The principle,
however, remains unshaken that singing in a correct
way is the greatest possible &#8220;bracer.&#8221;
<p>
It is best to remain absolutely quiet and see no one
on the day of the performance, so as not to be enervated
by the effort of talking much, to say nothing of
tiring the vocal chords. One prima donna of my
acquaintance occupies herself in trimming hats on the
day when she sings, believing that this provides a
distraction and rests her nerves. It is just as well not to
&#8220;pass through&#8221; the rôle that is to be sung on the day
of the appearing, but in the morning a few technical
exercises to keep the voice in tune, as it were, are to be
<a name="p65"><u>recommended</u></a>. <span class="odd"><a href="#nav">65</a></span> The great Italian singers of other days
followed this rule, and it still holds good.
<p>
If the singer gives much of himself as well as of his
voice to the public he should still hold his breathing
supply in, so to speak, as he would guard the capital
from which comes his income. Failure should thus be
impossible if there is always a reserve to draw on. So
the more one sings with good breath support the more
beautiful the voice becomes. On the other hand, those
who sing haphazard sometimes begin the evening well,
but deteriorate more and more as the performance
advances and at the end are uttering mere raucous sounds.
They are like a man unable to swim who is in a deep
river&#8212;their voices control them in place of they
controlling their voices. They struggle vainly against
obstacles, but are carried away by the flood and are
finally engulfed in the waters.
<p>
Many too ambitious students are their own worst
enemies in the culture of their voices. Because they
have a large vocal power they want to shout all the
time in spite of the repeated admonitions of their masters,
who beg them to sing piano. But they hear nothing
except the noise they make themselves. Such
headstrong ones will never make a career, even with the
finest voices in the world. Their teachers should give
up trying to make them listen to reason and devote
their attention to those who merit it and want to study
seriously. Singing as an art is usually not considered
with enough earnestness. One should go to a singing
master as one goes to a specialist for a consultation and
follow with the greatest care his directions. If one
does not have the same respect and confidence one
places in a physician it must be because the singing
master does not really merit it, and it would be much
better to make a change at once.
<p>
<a name="p66"><u>In</u></a> <span class="even"><a href="#nav">66</a></span> general it is better not to stick entirely to one
teacher, for it is easy to get into a rut in this way, and
someone else may have a quite different and more
enlightening way of setting forth his ideas.
<p>
In taking up operatic work it is understood, of course,
that the singer must have mastered most of the technical
difficulties, so as not to be troubled with them when
they are encountered in some aria.
<p>
It is a most excellent thing to secure an engagement
in one of the small theatres abroad, where one may get
a large experience before trying to effect an entrance
into the bigger organizations of the great capitals.
<p>
But be sure that the voice is well placed before trying
any of this sort of work, and never attempt to sing a rôle
above your powers in the earlier stage of your career,
which otherwise may be compromised permanently.
<p>
One more bit of advice in closing. The best sort of
lesson possible is to go often to the opera and note well
the methods of the great artists. This personal
example is worth more and is more illuminating than
many precepts.
<p>
This is not so much that any form of imitation may
be attempted as to teach the would-be artist how to
present at his best all those telling qualities with which
he may be endowed. It is the best of schools.</div>

HE most visible phase of the opera singer&#8217;s life
when he or she is in view of the public on the
stage is naturally the one most intimately connected
in the minds of the majority of people with
the singer&#8217;s personality, and yet there are many
happenings, amusing or tragic, from the artist&#8217;s point of
view, which, though often seen, are as often not realized
in their true significance by the audience in front of the
orchestra. One might naturally think that a singer
who has been appearing for years on the operatic stage
in many lands would have overcome or outgrown that
bane of all public performers, stage fright. Yet such is
far from the case, for it seems as though the greater
the artistic temperament the more truly the artist feels
and the more of himself he puts into the music he sings
the greater his nervousness beforehand. The latter is
of course augmented if the performance is a first night
and the opera has as yet been untried before a larger
public.
<p>
This advance state of miserable physical tension is
the portion of all great singers alike, though in somewhat
varying degrees, and it is interesting to note the
forms it assumes with different people. In many it is
shown by excessive irritability and the disposal to pick
quarrels with anyone who comes in contact with them.
This is an unhappy time for the luckless &#8220;dressers,&#8221;
wig man and stage hands, or even fellow artists who
encounter such singers before their first appearance in
the evening. Trouble is the portion of all such.
<p>
In other artists the state of mind is indicated by a
<a name="p68"><u>stern</u></a> <span class="even"><a href="#nav">68</a></span> set countenance and a ghastly pallor, while still
others become slightly hysterical, laugh uproariously at
nothing or burst into weeping. I have seen a big six-foot
bass singer, very popular at the opera two or three
seasons ago, walking to and fro with the tears running
down his cheeks for a long time before his entrance, and
one of our greatest coloratura prima donnas has come
to me before the opera, sung a quavering note in a voice
full of emotion and said, with touching accents: &#8220;See,
that is the best I can do. How can I go on so?&#8221;
<p>
I myself have been affected often by such fright,
though not always in the extreme degree above
described. This nervousness, however, frequently shows
itself in one&#8217;s performance in the guise of indifferent
acting, singing off the key, etc. Artists are generally
blamed for such shortcomings, apparent in the early
part of the production, when, as a matter of fact, they
themselves are hardly conscious of them and overcome
them in the course of the evening. Yet the public,
even critics, usually forget this fact and condemn an
entire performance for faults which are due at the
beginning to sheer nervousness.
<p>
The oft-uttered complaint that operatic singers are
the most difficult to get on with of any folk, while
justified, perhaps, can certainly be explained by the
foregoing observations.
<p>
<a name="n3r">We</a> of the opera are often inclined to be superstitious
in a way that might annul <a href="#n3"><sup>3</sup></a> matter of fact Americans.
One woman, a distinguished and most intelligent artist,
crosses herself repeatedly before taking her &#8220;cue,&#8221; and a
prima donna who is a favorite on two continents and
who is always escorted to the theatre by her mother,
invariably goes through the very solemn ceremony of
kissing her mother good-by and receiving her blessing
<a name="p69"><u>before</u></a> <span class="odd"><a href="#nav">69</a></span> going on to sing. The young woman feels that
she could not possibly sing a note if the mother&#8217;s eye
were not on her every moment from the wings.
<p>
Another famous singer wears a small bracelet that
was given to her when an infant by Gounod. She has
grown somewhat stout of late years, and the hoop of
gold has been reënforced so often that there is hardly
any of the great composer&#8217;s original gift left. Still,
she feels that it is a charm which has made her success,
and whether she sings the part of a lowly peasant or of
a princess the bracelet is always visible.
<p>
And these little customs are not confined to the
woman singers either, for the men are equally fond of
observing some little tradition to cheer them in their
performance. These little traits, trivial perhaps in
themselves, are of vital importance in that they create a
sense of security in the soul of the artist, who goes on
his way, if not rejoicing, at least convinced that the fates
are not against him.
<p>
One of the penalties paid by the singers who are
much in the public eye is the constant demand made
on them to listen to voices of vocal aspirants&#8212;not
always very young ones, strange to say. It is sad to
contemplate the number of people who think they can
sing and are destined by talent and temperament for
operatic careers, who have been led by misguided or
foolish friends and too often by overambitious and
mercenary singing masters into spending time and
money on their voices in the fond hope of some day
astonishing the world. Alas, they do not realize that
the great singers who are heard in the New York opera
houses have been picked from the world&#8217;s supply
after a process of most drastic selection, and that it is
only the most rarely exceptional voice and talent which
<a name="p70"><u>after</u></a> <span class="even"><a href="#nav">70</a></span> long years of study and preparation become
worthy to join the elect.
<p>
I am asked to hear many who have voices with
promise of beauty, but who have obviously not the
intelligence necessary to take up a career, for it does
require considerable intelligence to succeed in opera, in
spite of opinions to the contrary expressed by many.
Others, who have keen and alert minds and voices of
fine quality, yet lack that certain esprit and broadness
of musical outlook required in a great artist. This lack
is often so apparent in the person&#8217;s manner or bearing
that I am tempted to tell him it is no use before he
utters a note. Yet it would not do to refuse a hearing
to all these misfits, for there is always the chance of
encountering the unknown genius, however rare a bird
he may be.
<p>
And how often have the world&#8217;s great voices been
discovered by chance, but fortunately by some one
empowered to bring out the latent gift!
<p>
One finds in America many beautiful voices, and
when one thinks of the numerous singers successfully
engaged in operatic careers both here and abroad, it
cannot with justice be said as it used to be several years
ago that America does not produce opera singers.
Naturally a majority of those to whom I give a hearing
here in New York are Americans, and of these are a
number of really remarkable voices and a fairly good
conception of what is demanded of an opera singer.
<p>
Sometimes, however, it would be amusing if it were
not tragic to see how much off the track people are
who have been led to think they have futures. One
young man who came recently to sing for me carried a
portentous roll of music and spoke in the deepest of
bass voices. When asked what his main difficulty was
<a name="p71"><u>he</u></a> <span class="odd"><a href="#nav">71</a></span> replied that he &#8220;didn&#8217;t seem to be able to get on the
key.&#8221; And this was apparent when he started in and
wandered up and down the tonal till he managed to
strike the tonic. Then he asked me whether I
would rather hear &#8220;Qui sdegno,&#8221; from Mozart&#8217;s
&#8220;Magic Flute,&#8221; or &#8220;Love Me and the World is Mine.&#8221;
Upon the latter being chosen he asked the accompanist
to transpose it, and upon this gentleman&#8217;s suggesting
a third lower, he said: &#8220;No, put it down an octave.&#8221;
And that&#8217;s where he sang it, too. I gently but firmly
advised the young man to seek other paths than musical
ones. However, such extreme examples as that are
happily rare.
<p>
I would say to all young people who are ambitious to
enter on a career of opera: Remember, it is a thoroughly
hard-worked profession, after all; that even with a
voice of requisite size and proper cultivation there is
still a repertory of rôles to acquire, long months and
years of study for this and requiring a considerable feat
of memory to retain them even after they are learned.
Then there is the art of acting to be studied, which is,
of course, an entire occupation in itself and decidedly
necessary in opera, including fencing&#8212;how to fall
properly, the various gaits and gestures wherewith to
portray different emotions, etc. Then, as opera is
sung nowadays, the knowledge of the diction of at least
three languages&#8212;French, German and Italian&#8212;if not
essential, is at least most helpful.
